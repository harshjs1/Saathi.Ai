Saathi AI – A Mental Health Companion

As part of my exploration into Generative AI and its applications for social impact, I built Saathi AI, a mental health chatbot designed to provide supportive, empathetic, and context-aware conversations using natural language processing and large language models. The goal of this project was to create an intelligent assistant that helps users cope with stress, anxiety, and emotional challenges through reflective dialogue.

This chatbot uses OpenAI’s GPT model to generate human-like responses, while NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer and RAKE algorithm are used to understand the emotional state of the user and extract meaningful keywords from their input. The system maintains conversation history through memory buffers to ensure consistency and contextual relevance throughout the interaction.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of conversational AI, prompt engineering, and text analysis. It also helped me explore ethical AI development in sensitive domains like mental wellness.
Tech Stack

    Python

    OpenAI API (GPT-3/4)

    NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

    RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)

    LangChain (Memory management – optional)

    Jupyter Notebook

Features

    Sentiment Analysis: Detects the emotional tone of user input to guide responses.

    Empathetic Conversations: Generates thoughtful replies tailored to the user's mood.

    Keyword Extraction: Identifies stress-related topics using keyword ranking algorithms.

    Contextual Memory: Maintains previous conversation history to improve relevance.

    Supportive Prompts: Suggests affirmations and mental health journaling exercises.

Usage

Once the chatbot notebook is launched, the user can start interacting by entering any message related to how they’re feeling or what’s on their mind. The AI will analyze the sentiment and context of the input, then generate a supportive and empathetic response. Based on the mood and keywords, the chatbot may suggest affirmations, prompts for reflection, or further dialogue to support mental well-being.
